- Pandas

## Follwowing Steps Are Performed in this Project
1. Data Cleaning / Preprocessing - Pandas

        - Deal with missing values appropriately. You can either remove them or fill them, but a proper justification is required.

        - Duplicates in the dataset introduces bias in the study. Please check and perform appropriate steps.
        
        - Please remove special characters from the name column.
        
3. Inserting Data in SQL from CSV file  - PyMySQl Library
4. Normalize Database
5. Entity Relationship Diagram from Normalize Database

7. Analyzing Data with help of SQL Query
         - Find the average number of medals won by each country
         
         - Display the countries and the number of gold medals they have won in decreasing order

         - Which country has won the most number of medals (cumulative)
        
7. Analyzing Data with help of Pyspark Framewoek

        - Write PySpark code to print the Olympic Sports/games in the dataset.
        
        - Write PySpark code to plot the total number of medals in  each Olympic Sport/game
       
        - Sort the result based on the total number of medals.
        
        - Find the total number of medals won by each country in swimming.

11. Feature Enginnering in above of this steps.

          - Please check if the age dataset is skewed or symmetric. Based on results perform transformation.
