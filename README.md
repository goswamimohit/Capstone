## Follwowing Steps Are Performed in this Project
1. Data Cleaning / Preprocessing - Pandas

        - Deal with missing values appropriately. You can either remove them or fill them, but a proper justification is required.
        
        - Duplicates in the dataset introduces bias in the study. Please check and perform appropriate steps.
        
        - Please remove special characters from the name column.
        
3. Inserting Data in SQL from CSV file  - PyMySQl Library
4. Normalize Database
5. Entity Relationship Diagram from Normalize Database
6. Analyzing Data with help of SQL Query
